### Description
API routes are used to handle server-side logic. These routes are defined in the `src/app/api` folder and are used to perform operations such as handling authentication, etc.

### Notice
As our application uses `springboot` as backend, we will reduce the use of API routes in the `src/app/api` folder. Instead, we will use the `src/app/data-access` folder to handle the server-side logic.
